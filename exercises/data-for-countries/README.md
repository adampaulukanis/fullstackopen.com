# Data for countries step2

Improve on the app so that when the names of multiple countries are shown there
is a button next to the name of the country, which when pressed shows the view
for that country.

# Bugs

There is some annoying bug. An example of it is when you try to type in "Sudan"
for instance and it displays two countries: Sudan and South Sudan. To display
Sudan (not South Sudan) one needs to double click on "show" button. It sort of
works.
